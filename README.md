## Mix

![Mix Logo](docs/img/mix_logo_small.png)

**Mix** is a minimalistic inventory and picking web application for small teams.

Mix was originally designed to help [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)
teams manage parts for their build. However, it is generally not opinionated and
could possibly be used for similar scenarios and projects.

Mix is not intended to be a feature-complete [MRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning)
or [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) platform.

Mix supports first-class [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Slack](https://slack.com/)
integrations to keep everyone in the loop.
